# Climate Copilot

A climate change chatbot powered by Pinecone and OpenAI. This application is for demonstration purposes only, and is not intended for production use.

## Features

- Ask about climate change via single questions or conversationally 
- Information from the [Climate Change Committee](https://www.theccc.org.uk/)

## Get started

### Installing

Clone the repository and install the Python dependencies, run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### API keys

You will need access to a Pinecone and OpenAI API key. Save these as environment variables. For example,

```bash
export PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Save your Pinecone vector database information as environment variables. For example,

```bash
export PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_index_name
export PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_index_environment
```


### Load data

Before the application can be run, you will need to load the data into Pinecone. To do this, run

```bash
python -m climate_copilot --load-resources
```

This will require your Pinecone and OpenAI accounts, and may take a few minutes to complete.

You can load more data to the index by adding more PDFs to the resources directory and running the command again.

### Usage

To ask a question:

```bash
python -m climate_copilot --ask "What is the best way to reduce my carbon footprint?"
```

To run the application in a conversational mode:

```bash
python -m climate_copilot --converse
```

For help, run

```bash
python -m climate_copilot --help
```
